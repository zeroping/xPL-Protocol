== SENDMSG.SMTP Message Specification ==

*Class = SENDMSG
*Type = SMTP

This Schema extends the SENDMSG.BASIC Schema to provide the required fields to support sending messages through an SMTP Gateway from an xPL Network.

A message from the xPL network causes a message to be sent through an SMTP Server, which can either be specified within the body of the message, or through a "settings" option within the App. The Gateway application will send a Trigger to reflect the status of the outbound message.
