== REMOTE.BASIC Message Specification ==

*Class = remote
*Type  = basic

This Schema provides a method of interacting with remote control devices within an xPL implementation.

Note that this schema is not intended for transmission or reception of raw infra-red data - the ir.basic schema should be used for this purpose.  The remote.basic schema should be reserved for higher-level control, e.g. where actual keycode or button names are used.

== XPL-TRIG Structure ==

 remote.basic
 {
 keys=<button names or keycodes> - comma seperated values
 [device=<name or devicecode of device>]
 [zone=<ir zone>]
 }

== XPL-CMND Structure ==

 remote.basic
 {
 keys=<button names or keycodes> - comma seperated values
 [device=<name or devicecode of device to control>]
 [zone=<ir zone>] 
 [delay=<wait inbetween sending each button, 1000 = 1 second>]
 }


== XPL-STAT Structure ==

 hbeat.*
 {
 (hbeat items)
 }


== Schema Specific Notes ==

Device / applications based on this schema may implement either:
xpl-trig
xpl-cmnd
or both

If sending an xpl-trig in response to an incoming xpl-cmnd, ensure that the schema type used is remote.confirm rather than remote.basic. This allows another xPL device to Differentiate between genuine incoming trigger messages, and trigger messages sent in response to a command message.

The value of zone= needs to be matchable within the device/application
Use either a user-defined zone setting, 
or (preferably) the device/application Instance
