== Schema Specific Notes ==

The CID.METEOR Schema is an extension of the [[Schema - CID.BASIC|CID.BASIC]] Schema

Please be aware that devices/applications that filter on CID.* will receive multiple
messages from this Schema variant

*CCS (Current Call Status) values:
*INITIATED = The phone has gone off hook
*COMPLETE = the call has completed normally
*TERMINATED = the call has been abnormally terminated
*CID = caller ID information is being returned
*NOCID = no caller ID information is being returned - examine the RNN (Reason for No Number) parameter to establish the cause
*RING = Sent each time the phone rings
*ANSWERED = An incoming call has been answered
*DIGIT = a DTMF digit has been pressed - examine the CD (current digit) parameter to read the value of the digit that has been pressed.
