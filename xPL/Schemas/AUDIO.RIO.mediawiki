== Schema Specific Notes ==

The xPL modifications work within the confinements of the Rioplay software

The initial heartbeat is hbeat.basic rather than config.basic as the xPL system
will reconfigure itself to a default instance of "unitppp"
where ppp = last 3 digits of ip address (or p or pp)

The hostname and current vendor-source.instance and server address:port
have been added to the Rioplay 'about' menu for ease of use

The Rioplay xPL modifications ONLY accept TARGETTED messages

The ANNOUNCE command takes a parameter like
Microsoft Mary\Hello World
The first part is the voice, and is optional
A partial voice name can also be supplied like Mary\Hello
The text should be in WAV format and can be served either from pre-recorded texts from a web server or on the fly using xpl_riotts application.

The Rio will also respond to targetted TTS.BASIC messages, and with amendment to the filters it will also respond to broadcast TTS.BASIC messages
